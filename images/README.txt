LOGO IMAGE PLACEMENT

Please place your logo image file here as:
  - images/logo.png

The logo should be:
  - A heraldic emblem with flags and shield
  - PNG format with transparent background (recommended)

Supported formats:
  - logo.png (recommended)
  - logo.jpg

If you use a different filename or format, update the src attribute in all HTML files:

The logo will automatically:

  - Scale to 45px height on mobile
  - Have a subtle yellow glow effect
  - Slightly scale up on hover
  - Work perfectly with the dark background theme
